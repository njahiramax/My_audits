# Smart Contract & Blockchain Security Audit Reports

This repository contains smart contract and blockchain security audit reports written and compiled by me. All documents are in PDF format and reflect thorough, independent reviews of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, token contracts, and blockchain-based systems.

## 🗂️ Contents

Each audit report includes the following sections (when applicable):

- **Project Overview** – Basic information about the protocol or smart contract under review.
- **Scope of Audit** – Details of the codebase covered, including commit hashes or deployment addresses.
- **Methodology** – Description of the tools, frameworks, and manual techniques used in the audit.
- **Findings Summary** – List of issues categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational).
- **Detailed Findings** – In-depth analysis of each vulnerability with reproduction steps and recommendations.
- **Remediation Review** – Follow-up analysis (if applicable) after fixes are applied.
- **Conclusion** – Final thoughts on the security posture and trustworthiness of the contract.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

- Manual code review  
- Static analysis (Slither, Mythril, etc.)  
- Formal verification (when applicable)  
- Testing on testnets and local environments  
- Attack surface mapping  
- Simulation of known exploit vectors

## 🔐 Disclaimer

These audits are shared for informational purposes only. An audit does **not** guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities. Always perform your own due diligence and security checks before interacting with any blockchain system or contract.
